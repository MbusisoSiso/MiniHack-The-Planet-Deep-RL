# MiniHack-The-Planet-Deep-RL
## Introduction
A repository containing python implementations of deep reinforcement learning to solve complex problems on the minihack environment. Minihack is qouted to be 'A sandbox framework for easily designing rich and diverse environments for Reinforcement Learning (RL). Based on the game of NetHack'.

## Deep Q-Learning Network
All files required in order to run the DQN model are contained in the DQN file. In order to run simply type 'python3 DQN.py' in order to train and recieve results for the DQN model. 
The packages required in order to run include:
 - Pytorch
 - FPDF
 - NLE
 - OS
 - PIL
 - Gym

All relevant architecture information is provided in the 'Reinforcement_learning_writeup.pdf'. The standard architecture of a DQN model can be seen below
